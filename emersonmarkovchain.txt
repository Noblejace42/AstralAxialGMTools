I’m the Maas, bruise‑dark and restless, and I clock everything the land won’t admit. When evening slumps over the Alblasserwaard, I’m already gnawing at the basalt under Molendijk, sneaking through muskrat burrows the engineers pretend aren’t there. I taste the raw peat steam, the cow dung, the stale smoke curling off shuttered hearths. I feel the Verdronken Hof nudge my flank at Dordrecht—old side‑wheeler wheezing tar and regret—while dockhands thud beet crates onto her ribs. She shivers when that stranger pays in damp guilders and steps aboard, mildew and static trailing him into the lounge. Above, stares with one glass eye and one tired human one, muttering about rising water and locks that won’t hold. I hear him. I’m already lifting.
By the time thunder fractures the Betuwe sky, I’m done playing polite canal. I hurl rain sideways, crank the paddle wheel into brown froth, slam steam through rusted seams. Deck chairs skitter; the grand piano coughs its last chord. Then I flex—one solid wall—and pop her boiler like a tin toy. Plates buckle, rivets ping, flame and steam blur into my night. The diving bell drops, chalked names erased in my silt. The stranger bails over the rail; I carry him north, past the locks he’ll curse forever. When dawn drags its grey light across Papendrecht, I spit wreckage and hymnals onto the floodplain, keep the ship’s true epitaph buried in my tide. Officials will blame metal fatigue and pilot error, but I’ll keep grinding away, patient as rot, because rivers remember what paper forgets.

Shrewd Measures
I — Metronome
 My stomach twitches like a loose snare drum, rattling the ribs that fence my lightning‑slick heart. Every footfall hums up through the dirt as if the whole world were a speaker cone made just for me. Scent—not sight—maps the maze: beetle musk, root rot, the iron tang of worm slime. I ghost‑skate between stems, whiskers ticking like radar. A woodlouse clicks once, twice—enough. I pounce, bite, gulp in the same heartbeat, the kill already fading behind the next hunger‑beat. I am a perpetual spark, burning calories faster than frost can snuff me, and the dark soil keeps score with the heat of my passing.
II — Seismograph
 The tunnel is memory in clay: every scrape of claw, every brush of fur against loam archived in the walls. I read vibrations the way skylings read constellations—paw‑pads translating tremors into coordinates. Above, an owl’s pin‑drop wingbeat warps the ceiling; I freeze, heart throttled down to stealth. Silence swells, a pressure in the ears. When the quake of danger drifts off, I exhale humid relief that beads on my whiskers. Moving again, I draft fresh corridors, braiding fear and instinct into architecture. Down here, sound is sight, and I am cartographer and cartography at once.
III — Fuse
 Cold comes as a blunt arithmetic: degree by degree, the sum of what I’ve stored subtracts itself. I ballast the nest with shredded grass and my own twitching heat, pups tucked like living embers against my belly. Outside, snow hushes the world; inside, my pulse is the last drum at a dead rave. Sleep would be sweet, but loosening grip means extinction—so I cycle through micro‑dreams, jerking awake to count breaths that steam the thatch. When dawn finally bleeds pink through the entrance, I taste thaw on the air. Another day purchased on credit, interest compounding in marrow and will. My very being contracts to this: keep the fuse lit, whatever the cost.
IV — Barometer
 The sky’s mood presses through soil like a thumbprint on wet clay. When air weight drops, dew smells different—copper‑bright, storm‑bent. My fur spikes into antennae, logging hectopascals in gooseflesh code. I stuff my cheek‑pouches with calories as hedge against the coming downpour; hunger is an isobar I refuse to cross. A thunderhead clears its throat miles away, yet the pressure curve is already an itch beneath my scapulae. I pilot the tunnels deeper, each chamber a low‑pressure safe room. Down here, the weather can only guess where I went.
V — Oscilloscope
 Nerves fire in neon squiggles, Fraunhofer lines against the dark inside of my skull. I chirp ultrasound—pop!—and the echo punches back, a glowing waveform of root knots and pill bugs. Every blip is coordinates, every trough a void to avoid. Predators register as dirty noise, distortion that fuzzes the clean sinusoid of normal earth‑hum. I ride the signal like a DJ chasing a drop, tweaking my trajectory until the line steadies and the mix is pure.
VI — Hourglass
 Calories sift from liver to muscle to motion, sand in a glass I can’t flip. Each grain burned raises the lower bulb—life—by a micron, though the top empties faster than I can watch. I hoard beetles like time‑lords hoard seconds, yet the flow keeps slipping through the waist. My solution? Sprint harder. If the sand refuses to stay, I’ll make art of its descent: glyphs of claw‑marks, pup heartbeats, tunneling arabesques carved into the finite arc of falling time.
VII — Tuning Fork
 At dusk I sing—no bigger than a toothpick ping, but perfectly pitched. The ground answers, forks into sympathetic vibration, mapping nest‑mates and mates‑to‑be in a chorus of resonant nodes. Wave meets wave, crests align, space blooms into coordinates of belonging. In that shared frequency my pulse slows, just for a blink, and the universe filters out noise to leave one clean note: alive‑alive‑alive. When silence retakes the wick, I pocket the tone like flint and strike it against the dark, ready for the next measure.

Exec Summary - 
Weakest Link is a digital peer-to-peer micro-lending platform that turns small donor contributions into affordable working-capital loans for under-banked entrepreneurs in Kenya, South Africa, Peru, and Cuba. The service uses audited Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to automate disbursement, repayment, and public reporting, giving both donors and borrowers an experience that feels like a mainstream fintech app while preserving blockchain-level transparency. Interest payments are capped at five to nine percent, far below the twelve to nineteen percent often charged by local digital lenders, and any surplus is automatically redirected into community infrastructure such as solar panels, clean water projects, or shared Wi-Fi hubs.
The addressable market on the borrower side is expanding fast. Smartphone penetration already tops sixty-five percent in Kenya and Peru, and mobile usage is rising in South Africa despite patchy power infrastructure. Typical borrowers are micro-retailers, farmers, and gig workers earning between ninety and three hundred fifty US dollars per month, whose chief barriers are double-digit inflation, lack of collateral, and long travel times to reach brick-and-mortar banks. On the donor side, Gen Z and millennial professionals in North America and Europe increasingly favor traceable social impact over pure charity, driving an eleven percent compound annual growth in global microfinance to about two hundred fifteen billion dollars in 2024. Weakest Link fits neatly between zero-interest nonprofits such as Kiva and yield-focused DeFi pools such as Goldfinch, offering donors real-time proof of impact and borrowers fair rates.
A detailed competitive scan shows four threat categories. Brand competitors like Kiva own mindshare around philanthropic lending yet struggle to scale during downturns. Product competitors such as Tala leverage telecom data to issue short-term loans but face looming interest-rate caps. Blockchain-native pools like Goldfinch attract institutional capital but expose participants to smart-contract exploits. Finally, any retail savings vehicle or remittance service competes for the same donor wallet. Weakest Link differentiates through its audited public ledger, a central liquidity pool that lets even small donations reach many borrowers, and its charitable tax status in select jurisdictions.
Four quantified objectives anchor the first operating year: raise and allocate an initial donor liquidity pool; deploy at least eighty percent of raised funds into active loans; reach fifteen percent brand awareness in core donor markets; and keep portfolio-at-risk over thirty days below six percent. Success will be tracked by a cross-functional executive team comprising a compliance-oriented CFO, an engineering-heavy CTO division focused on Layer-2 cost reduction, and a data-driven CMO who oversees influencer collaborations and referral incentives. Break-even is projected within twenty-four to thirty-six months, funded by borrower interest margins, cooperative integration fees, and selective grants tied to infrastructure outcomes.
The marketing mix is engineered for trust and accessibility. Product design pairs a bold chain-and-dollar logo with a mobile interface that works over USSD, SMS, and WhatsApp in low-bandwidth regions. Pricing policy keeps interest below local credit ceilings, eliminates hidden fees, and rewards early repayment with gas-fee rebates and bigger future loan limits. Distribution relies on partnerships with farming cooperatives and artisan collectives, supported by multilingual field agents who handle onboarding and identity verification. Promotion budgets emphasize social-proof storytelling, user-generated video testimonials, and campaigns built around the tagline “See the chain of your impact.”
A comprehensive SWOT and PESTEL review highlights critical risk vectors. Strengths include first-mover blockchain transparency and a donation model that can deliver tax deductions to donors. Weaknesses center on dependence on voluntary contributions and the need to demystify crypto concepts for mainstream users. Opportunities lie in global internet expansion via projects like Starlink, plus rising dissatisfaction with opaque charities. Threats encompass multi-jurisdictional regulation, liquidity shocks, and cyberattacks on custody wallets. The company is countering these threats with region-specific compliance officers, a dedicated cybersecurity unit, layered insurance on the liquidity pool, and a tree-planting program to offset blockchain energy use until more efficient consensus methods mature.
Operational implementation focuses on building technical resilience and cultural alignment. Early hiring expands the information-technology team to troubleshoot smart-contract issues, while customer support staff are trained to work across cultures and bandwidth constraints. Remote-first policies, competitive benefits, and periodic field visits to borrower communities strengthen employee engagement. Continuous feedback loops with both lenders and borrowers will inform rapid product tweaks and future marketing narratives. Key performance metrics include user acquisition cost, average loan size progression, repayment velocity, and social amplification rates from donor shares.
If the team executes on these milestones, Weakest Link can redefine trust in microfinance by delivering verifiable impact at scale, easing credit frictions for thousands of small enterprises, and channeling excess capital into lasting community assets. The platform’s dual promise—financial dignity for borrowers and radical transparency for donors—positions it to become the reference standard for socially responsible digital lending in emerging markets.

Intro/Product Description ()

https://hopelesspoetic.com/weakestlink.html (sorry abt the url lol its just hosted on my personal domain)

Imagine opening an app that works like a community treasure chest: anyone can drop in a few dollars, and that money instantly turns into tiny, low-cost loans for shop-owners in Kenya, farmers in Peru, or electricians in South Africa who just need a quick boost to keep their businesses humming. Every cent you contribute is tracked on a public digital ledger, so you can see exactly where it goes and when it comes back. As borrowers repay, you earn a bit of interest, get a shareable impact badge, and watch photos and updates roll in showing new solar panels, upgraded tractors, or stocked-up market stalls made possible by your support. No banks, no hidden fees, no guessing—just clear proof that your spare change became real-world change.
The magic behind the scenes is blockchain, but you never have to touch crypto jargon to benefit. We handle the tech while you enjoy a slick, mobile-first experience: deposit with a debit card, pick projects that speak to you, and track progress in a feed that feels like social media for doing good. Surplus interest gets reinvested into local infrastructure, so your impact keeps snowballing long after the first loan is repaid. It is simple: you help a neighbor across the globe catch a financial break, they grow their income, and entire communities get stronger. Join Weakest Link and turn small dollars into big ripple effects—because when every link is sturdy, the whole chain thrives.

How does the product answer the customers needs 

The Weakest Link aims to aid those in environments where the centralized banks and banking is hard to acquire. Additionally areas with more economic downturn and higher inflation. Areas such as Kenya, South Africa, Cuba, and Peru are good focus areas for the company as small business owners and entrepreneurs in these areas face similar issues. Farmers and entrepreneurs for unique small businesses face volatile and seasonal markets with median monthly income ranges. These borrowers would have the goal of growing their business to support their families and the people around them. They might want to buy certain tools to grow their business or start one up. Using The Weakest Link is accessible via the phone so borrowers who have access to the internet are who the company would target in each of these areas.
 On the other side, our company focuses on lenders for supplying the money for the borrowers. Weakest Link lenders are individuals who use their money to support global social impact rather than to seek financial returns. They typically come from developed countries and are drawn to the platform’s transparency and personal borrower stories. Many are motivated by a desire to help underserved communities gain access to credit and improve their economic standing. The lender base includes a mix of younger generations like Millennials and Gen Z, as well as older donors who are deeply committed to charitable giving. They are comfortable with digital platforms, often lend small amounts starting at $25, and value the ability to track exactly how their contribution is used and the outcomes it supports.

Heavy Users:
Low income workers in financially downtrodden areas such as … 
Owners of small businesses such as small markets selling seasonal goods or unique products, farms or agricultural owners with seasonal sales.
Young Investors with strong senses of giving back to others and wanting to see their progress/impact of their investments with sturdy returns

Light Users:
Owners of medium sized businesses who need loans to grow
Older investors who have some desire to give back but might not compare
Situation Analysis ()
Research and describe how global/situational conditions have created a need for this product
Current Offering and Strategy
Weakest Link positions itself at the intersection of micro-credit and decentralized finance. The core value proposition is a global lending pool where donors earn modest yields while borrowers in Cuba, South Africa, Peru, and Kenya receive affordable, non-predatory loans. Smart contracts on Ethereum (or an EVM-compatible sidechain) automate disbursement and repayment, publish an immutable audit trail, and redirect surplus interest into local infrastructure projects and a peer-to-peer goods marketplace. The strategy solves two pain points simultaneously: donor distrust in opaque charities and borrower exclusion from traditional banks.
Internal Environment
Operationally the venture already controls three scarce resources: a functioning lending contract audited to industry standards, partnerships with local co-ops that vet borrowers, and a modest treasury of stablecoins to seed liquidity. Its talent bench skews toward engineers and community managers, giving it strong product velocity but thinner regulatory and compliance expertise. Near-term risks include Ethereum gas costs that spike during network congestion, the learning curve of onboarding non-technical borrowers, and the need for a larger liquidity buffer to absorb regional currency shocks. Looking ahead, Layer-2 roll-outs and account-abstraction wallets can tame gas fees, though they demand continuous engineering effort to keep contracts up to date.
Customer Environment
Borrowers are micro-retailers, farmers, and gig-workers whose median monthly income ranges from roughly USD 90 in rural Cuba to USD 350 in peri-urban Kenya. Their chief obstacles are double-digit inflation, sparse collateral, and travel distances to brick-and-mortar banks. Smartphone penetration now exceeds sixty-five percent in Kenya and Peru and continues to climb in South Africa, making mobile wallets a viable delivery channel. Donors on the other side skew millennial and Gen Z, value traceability, and prefer impact investing over pure charity. The platform’s clear on-chain metrics and a social-media style feed of funded projects map neatly onto these preferences.
External Environment
Economic conditions differ sharply across the focus countries. Kenya is projected to expand 5.6 percent in 2025, providing rising disposable income and a supportive fintech culture. Peru’s economy is set to grow about 3.2 percent but faces increased policy uncertainty which can dampen loan demand. South Africa wrestles with unemployment above thirty-two percent, a reality that heightens credit risk while also enlarging the addressable borrower pool. Cuba remains the most fragile market, fighting inflation near twenty-five percent and sporadic access to foreign exchange. These macro trends shape borrowers’ repayment capacity and dictate how low the platform can push interest rates without eroding its sustainability.
Industry economics show microfinance expanding at an eleven percent CAGR, hitting roughly USD 215 billion in 2024. Digital rails are increasingly favored because they slash distribution costs, but the downturn in African fintech funding—down forty-five percent year-on-year—signals tougher capital markets and a higher bar for proof of traction. Raw-material inputs are minimal; the real cost drivers are validator fees, cybersecurity audits, local field-agent stipends, and capital reserves to manage currency volatility.
Regulatory and political issues loom large. Kenya’s Central Bank now licenses digital credit providers under tighter consumer-protection rules, raising compliance overhead yet also conferring legitimacy. South Africa will enforce the FATF “Travel Rule” on crypto transfers by April 2025, mandating robust KYC data sharing. In Cuba, recent OFAC amendments marginally loosen U.S. sanctions, opening a cautious path for cross-border stablecoin flows but still requiring a Central Bank license. Peru maintains a deliberately light fintech framework with no specific fee caps, allowing flexible pricing models.
Competitive Landscape
Brand competitors targeting the same donor psychology include Kiva, which has surpassed USD 2 billion in cumulative loans and lends at zero interest, relying on donations to cover costs. Product competitors like Tala issue short-term unsecured credit via mobile apps, have served ten million customers, and deployed USD 6 billion, demonstrating scale and embedded data science for risk scoring. Blockchain-native competitors such as Goldfinch pool over one thousand institutional private-credit loans with yields of ten to twelve percent. Generic competitors are any charity, ESG fund, or retail savings product vying for the same philanthropic or investment dollars. Total-budget competitors include traditional remittance channels that relatives might otherwise use to support family members.
Kiva’s nonprofit model keeps interest at zero but depends on donor goodwill, limiting growth during economic downturns. Tala monetizes via origination and late fees, faces new CFPB-style interest caps in Kenya, but enjoys deep distribution partnerships with telecoms. Goldfinch targets institutional lenders, not end-borrowers, and carries smart-contract risk; nevertheless, its marketing spend dwarfs Weakest Link’s thanks to VC backing.
Societal and Demographic Shifts
Under-forty demographics dominate the populations of Kenya and Peru, and mobile-first behavior is standard. Cash usage is eroding in South Africa as regulatory clarity around crypto assets improves. Globally, donors display rising skepticism toward opaque charities and a preference for transparent, measurable impact backed by immutable data. These shifts validate the platform’s blockchain ledger as a trust engine while raising expectations for real-time reporting.
Impact on the Marketing Mix
Product features must keep evolving. Inflation-hedged stablecoins and optional local-currency swaps will become essential in Cuba and South Africa. Transparent yield dashboards satisfy donor value perceptions, while a gamified credit-score builder resonates with borrowers. Pricing must remain below local digital lenders yet well above break-even after gas fees and default provisions. Distribution hinges on lightweight mobile interfaces, USSD options for low-bandwidth zones, and local agent networks for cash-in and cash-out. Promotion should foreground audited impact metrics and donor stories delivered via influencer partnerships and community DAOs to tap viral trust networks. Finally, people strategy requires bilingual customer-success teams versed in both crypto onboarding and local credit counseling, plus compliance officers who track multi-jurisdictional AML rules.
Outlook
If Weakest Link leans into Layer-2 cost reductions, secures regional regulatory endorsements, and markets its surplus-to-infrastructure flywheel aggressively, it can occupy a distinct niche between zero-interest philanthropy and high-yield DeFi credit pools. Success will depend on matching the fluid macroeconomics of four very different countries with a unified yet adaptable product stack that donors recognize as both ethically grounded and financially sound.

SWOT Analysis - 
Strengths
Weakest Link’s greatest asset is its reliance on blockchain. It is the first microfinance company to do this, which protects it from outside interests by a third party investor or owner who may seek to extract profit from the company. This asset also provides prospective lenders with added security when making payments to the lending pool. Thanks to the company’s status as a charitable organization, lenders are incentivized to donate with perks such as tax benefits. The use of a lending pool to provide support to borrowers is another unique point which adds structure to the service, compared with contemporaries like Kiva. Our entry with a new, decentralized approach has the potential to remake the image of microfinance and of crowdsourcing, potentially jumpstarting the market and positioning our product as a leader. There is a strong need for financial support for underbanked populations, and Weakest Link has the potential to help in ways that benefit everyone.
Weaknesses
Weakest Link will rely on donations from lenders who are contributing to a centralized lending pool. This source of funds is independent of major investors, which frees the company from reliance on third party interests, however is less stable by comparison. Effective marketing is key to ensure new lenders are attracted to the service, and are then maintained through a positive user experience and benefits. Some people might be wary of lending their money to a service like this, be it that they don’t understand how it is used, or that they don’t understand the blockchain. Furthermore, there are stigmas against charity which must be overcome in order to reach a broad population (candid.org).
Opportunities
Weakest Link stands out from its contemporaries by its use of blockchain to safeguard transactions, and a centralized lending pool to provide structure to its loan system. This is a new approach to microfinance which can expand the market. This product comes at a time where internet access is being spread farther around the globe into remote and rural areas, thanks to companies like Starlink, which creates an opportunity for this market to grow as a larger pool of underbanked communities are able to seek out lending services online (Sciencedirect.com).
Threats
Operating a financial services institution, even on the level of microfinance, requires adhering to regulations which vary by country. If Weakest Link is to expand its reach globally, it will have to fine tune its service to comply with these regulations, making for complex programming and design challenges (margcompusoft). In addition, its operations and communications with the public must be unimpeachable. Kiva, one of Weakest Link’s contemporaries, has struggled with its reputation due to shady moves to hide interest rate information and reduce transparency about executive compensation, leading to concerns that their mission had shifted from creating change to creating revenue (technologyreview). Such a reputation shift could be catastrophic.
PESTEL Analysis - 
Political
The state of global commerce will affect the ease with which we can conduct our business overseas. If global relations deteriorate to the point where international internet access is limited, our company may have to move its operations elsewhere.
Economic
The state of the global economy has a major impact on our lending pool, as lenders must have disposable income to be able to donate to our service. We can target marketing toward growing economies, such as India, where people with newly-made fortunes may be more willing to give back and help those in need (IMF).
Social
We have the challenge of distinguishing ourselves to both the lender and borrower pools of users. Gaining a core base of lenders in a strong economy will provide a reliable base of funds, from which word of mouth can complement our marketing to drive growth. On the other side, we will need to make potential borrowers aware of the benefits of our service, especially in areas that are only just now gaining reliable internet access.
Technological
Our product relies on a digital interface for users on both ends: lending and borrowing. This interface must be easy to use in order to maintain frequent use from both areas, and it must be visually appealing and accessible enough to remain comfortable for use relative to other websites. Furthermore, our reliance on blockchain helps us to be transparent with payments and secure for lenders.
Environmental
The blockchain technology our service is based on is known for its high energy consumption. This makes sustainability a challenge while the world transitions to renewable resources. (pre-sustainability.com) As such, our environmental performance relies on technological advancements in the world. Until then, we will plant trees using our interest funds to offset the carbon emissions.
Legal
Our microfinance business will have to comply with any local regulations on financial institutions that apply in countries where we do business (margcompusoft). In addition, our website will have to comply with data collection and other privacy laws, which also vary on a local level.

Marketing Mix Strategy ()

Consumer strategy

 Weakest Link targets two key user groups. The first are the donors, tech-literate Gen Zs and Millenials in North America and Europe who are motivated by transparency, digital innovation, and measurable social impact. These individuals are frequently online, follow ethical finance influencers and are more likely to support platforms offering visible and trackable outcomes. Our second group are the borrowers, rural micro-entrepreneurs in Kenya, South Africa, Peru, and Cuba. Many are women working in agriculture, food and artisan sectors. They seek reliable, affordable capital to grow their businesses and avoid predatory lenders. Both groups value ease of use, trust and community empowerment. Donors act as both funders and brand advocates. Borrowers represent recurring users with high potential for retention. 

Product marketing strategy

 Weakest Link’s product strategy emphasizes both function and form. The brand name, Weakest Link, highlights our mission to strengthen vulnerable committed through transparent lending. Our logo features a bold yellow dollar sign encircled by a metal chain, with a singular green link standing out. This green link represents hope, change and connection, positioning our platform as a bridge between capital and impact. Our imagery reflects blockchain technology, financial empowerment, and resilience in underserved communities. 
 
At its core, Weakest Link enables blockchain-based lending with full transaction visibility, supported by smart contracts that automate loan creation, repayment and reinvestment. Donors receive real time dashboards tracking where and how their contributions are used, while borrowers benefit from an incentive system that unlocks larger loan amounts and voting rights on surplus reinvestment projects. To ensure accessibility, the platform supports mobile-friendly interactions via SMS and WhatsApp, supplemented by multilingual customer service and field agent assistance through local cooperatives. What sets Weakest Link apart is its unique fusion of crowdfunding transparency, microfinance reach and blockchain-level auditability.

Pricing strategy

 Weakest Link’s pricing strategy is designed to challenge predatory lending models while still remaining financially sustainable. Borrowers will pay interest rates between 5% and 9% annually, depending on local risk factors. A much more affordable rate compared to the 12% to 19% APRs charged by private lenders (Kenya Cost of Credit, n.d.). There will be no hidden fees, or late penalty traps that borrowers could fall into. Borrowers who repay early will receive gas fee rebates and gain access to higher loan tiers. Donors receive no financial return; instead, surplus interest is reinvested into community infrastructure projects such as solar power, clean water or Wi-Fi. In eligible countries, donor contributions may qualify for tax deductions (Lawsky, n.d.), adding financial benefit to social impact. Our financial model targets platform break-even within two or three years, supported by donor growth and borrower demand ​​(CGAP & MIX, 2010).

Supply chain strategy

 Accessibility and simplicity are key factors in Weakest Link’s distribution strategy. For borrowers, we’ll partner with local cooperatives, farming associates and artisan collectives to facilitate onboarding and support. We’ll hold info sessions and publish how-to videos making usage as accessible as possible. In more rural areas with limited internet access, borrowers will be able to utilize straightforward USSD, SMS and WhatApp systems to connect with local field agents available for in-person support. Donors engage through access to a website along with a mobile optimized platform where they can contribute funds, track outcomes, and receive automated repayment updates via smart contracts. To manage logistical risks, we implement borrower tiers to limit exposure during initial loans, and regional compliance officers handle ID verification and licensing (Anti-Financial Crime & Regulatory Compliance, n.d.). Field agents report loan outcomes in real time, ensuring accountability and support. 
 
Integrated marketing communication strategy

The integrated marketing communication (IMC) strategy focuses on trust building and early platform adoption. Our objectives include increasing brand awareness to 15% in pilot donor markets within 12 months and growing both donor and borrower referrals. About 15% of our Year 1 donor acquisition budget is allocated to promotional efforts. Consumer-facing promotions include the Impact Multiplier referral program, donation matching campaigns during launch, and monthly email newsletters featuring borrower success stories. Our advertising strategy includes paid campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn, as well as user generated video testimonials and collabs with ethical finance influencers (Insa, 2023). Public relation efforts aim for placements in fintech, blockchain, and global development outlets. Messaging will center on themes such as “See the chain of your impact,” “Your dollar doesn't disappear, it multiplies,” “Blockchain transparency. Real world change.” On the trade side, we offer onboarding bonuses and co-branded marketing materials for cooperatives, along with WhatsApp ready flyers and milestone incentives to drive field engagement. 
 
Our marketing mix strategy positions Weakest Link as an innovative and community first platform, differentiated by transparent, operational integrity, and a dual sided value proposition.

Marketing Implementation
Organization design, leadership structure - example below ()

Internal marketing strategy (incentives, training, benefits)

A strong internal marketing strategy is crucial to ensure our vision is carried out across the company, with participation from all employees.

Incentives

Training

Given the unique segment this service carves out, employees must be trained in its operation in a manner which focuses on what differentiates it. They’ll need to be given a strong understanding of the blockchain system and how to interface with it. This can be executed through online and in-person training courses. Employees should also be educated in practices for conducting exchanges across cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds, which can be facilitated through required reading material and engaging collaborative learning sessions.

Benefits

Because Weakest Link is a digital service, we can provide employees with an attractive hybrid work structure where they have the flexibility to work certain hours remotely. We believe we will attract a workforce who is charity-oriented and will take great pride in the genuine good that our service provides. This shared vision will foster a family-like culture. The company can sponsor in-person trips to underbanked regions where employees can interact directly with lenders to make sure the benefit of our service is being realized. Such trips will give employees a more tangible tie to their work, avoiding the risk of a disconnect created through digital separation from the users, allowing them to take further pride in it.

Evaluation and Controls (input, process, output)
Inputs

Before implementation takes place, the company must grow its information technology workforce in order to respond to teething issues with the service. Such issues are expected from a new online service, especially one which adopts new technology like blockchain. These information technology specialists will help to iron out these issues early. In addition, customer support that tailors to each region of operation must be developed to respond to specialized needs from different customers in different cultures.

Process

It is crucial that a constant dialogue be maintained with lenders and borrowers. If either of them feel there is an issue with the service that puts them at a disadvantage, such as the interest rates or centralized lending pool, we must be able to respond quickly to make sure our mission of providing transparent, secure financial assistance to underbanked populations is being upheld. Early success of the service has the potential to strengthen our future marketing further, so collecting this data from users to refine it will help to boost our reputation in support of this hope. In addition to being a company recognized for doing genuine good, we want to be recognized as a company that listens to its users.

Output

As implementation is underway, we’ll be monitoring the number of new and returning users, both in the lending and borrowing sides of the site, making sure to seek their feedback as mentioned previously. We will hope to share success stories from borrowers, further helping to inspire commitment in employees. In addition, we’ll keep constant watch over the lending pool to make sure it grows steadily. Controlling how these funds get executed will allow us to make sure the funds don’t drop below a certain point.

Risks
Low public interest
Ensuring our marketing is targeting the correct demographic in strong economies is crucial to ensure early success. If we don’t execute the marketing strategy correctly, we could see low public interest that makes initial fundraising difficult, if not impossible, harming our chances of success. Marketing specialists will be on hand to help refine our strategy as needed to avoid this issue.
Disputes with lenders and borrowers
One of the greatest concerns is dealing with anxiety in the event that lenders are unable to get money paid back, and that borrowers feel pressure to pay back their loans. This stress can harm the reputation of our service, so we’ll have to act internally to help prevent these situations from arising. We can implement a goal-based rewards program for borrowers who pay back their loans within certain timeframes, and a safety system to make sure lenders get at least their original sum paid back.
Hack
While blockchain is known for its security in protecting payment exchanges, there is always the possibility that our pool of funds will prove attractive enough to inspire cybercriminals to attempt to hack into our system. We will need to be prepared for this by practicing unimpeachable cybersecurity tactics and keeping a team of cybersecurity experts on hand to ensure our protection is up to date.
Global political environment
As is the same for all companies with international operations, we are impacted by any political moves that impact our ability to do business with our target populations, as well as our ability to do business internationally in general. We must remain aware of changes to the global political landscape, adapting to comply with all necessary regulations to ensure we can continue operating on our desired scale.
New competitors
There is the possibility that following our initial success, new competitors will try to enter the market. Blockchain can be freely adopted, so we’ll need to differentiate ourselves through our relations with our users. Because we’ll have a head start in this market from future competitors, the data we collect from users early on will give us a strong advantage. With our on-hand IT team, we’ll be able to adapt the service to make sure it can suit the needs of our users.
Make sure customer support, IT, cybersecurity, are included in leadership structure

Workshop Notes
Rhythmic, like a tale being told
Easy to understand somehow
Epigraph is cool: based
Hope as an underlying theme - hope and illusion
Definitely fun to read aloud
Didn’t overwhelm with worldbuilding
The storyteller is a silly lil guy
Does the enemy need to be talked about more
More clues in intro paragraph mayhaps

Lay Softly My Soul Unto The Earth
By 
I shall not yield to death in shameful plight;
But strive to forge a deed that all might praise.
Reveal the gloom; unmask the mortal night,
Ten thousand wicked devils march and sway
Here now the creeping dark knocks at my door,
Content with siege engine and trebuchet
For all who roam upon this fragile floor
Must stand, unbowed, and strive with all their might.
Let him who dares seize glory ere he falls;
Nor let the sands of fate drift on in vain;
By steadfast will, secure the laurel crown,
And carve a lasting name where hopes remain.
Thus shall my voice defy the hush of death,
And sing of hope triumphant with each breath.
, CV 1185

Hearken, dear sirs and gentlefolk, unto this vow that did flare in Redpeak’s most dire hour. For uncounted winters have I roamed these crooked roads, my tattered cloak flapping in the wind like the wings of some ragged crow. Possessed of naught but a battered lyre’s memory in my soul, I be a humble minstrel well acquainted with frayed boots and half-eaten crumbs. Yet illusions, dear friends, I have in abundance. Illusions as ephemeral as evening mist, illusions that flicker and dance before despair like a lone candle in an endless tunnel.
Attend me now, that I might weave this tapestry of words. Upon a craggy outcrop stands Redpeak - its crooked spires thrust into the heavens as though in challenge to the wind. Ancient banners, frayed as an old beggar’s cloak, once fluttered from those heights. Look ye well upon the leaning turrets, their gargoyles worn faceless by the march of years. Down below, a warren of alleys twist and coil, strewn with uneven stones that glisten in perpetual damp. A thousand and one stairways - some carved centuries ago, some newly hewn - ascend and descend in labyrinthine chaos, leading the curious astray. Hither and yon, vendors proclaim with hoarse voices the grand illusions of their wares - “Witness this helm, said to be forged from a comet’s heart!” - though in truth, the steel is as terrestrial as the mud beneath thy feet. Yet illusions do hold the city’s weary hearts, for illusions lend color to the bleak tapestry of a place battered by ill luck.
In that realm of dimly lit corners and high, wind-whipped parapets, came . A soldier of repute, for so the whispers ran, with scars like a map of hidden roads crisscrossing his flesh. His battered cuirass, chipped and scored by countless assaults, seemed to reflect not the bright promise of polished steel but the stubborn will of a man who dares stand upright though the world tilts. Rumor spake of twisted horrors advancing from the east, nightmares clad in flesh that was once human - nay, monstrous shapes that shambled under some unholy impetus. The folk of Redpeak, half-choking on their own dread, shuttered windows that had seen centuries of dawn. Children, wide-eyed as fawns, crept beneath broken tables or clutched tarnished amulets. The city’s illusions, of star-forged swords and endless bounty, trembled in the face of a foe whose name no tongue wished to utter.
On the eve preceding the final stand, inscribed a bold missive: “Let me not yield to death in shameful plight...” Quoth he in a trembling yet resolute script, as though the parchment might be the last vessel of his soul. By trick of fortune, that scroll passed to my unworthy hands. A wretch I was, cowering near his tent in quest of war-stories to spin into gold with my cunning tongue. No sooner had I pricked mine ear at the tent’s canvas flap than a hulking guard seized me, dragging me out as a cat might a scrawny rat. Next I knew, I was plunged into a cask of brine and salted fish - verily an indignity that reeked for many a day. Yet, with a dry and weary humor, the general spared me from worse punishment. A faint quirk of his lip betrayed mild amusement at my plight, and ere I could properly gather my senses, he thrust the parchment into my shaking grip. “Bear these words,” quoth he, “and carry them into memory if we perish.”
Thus burdened with a vow mightier than my usual trifles, I wandered Redpeak’s serpentine lanes that night. Clouds hung low, darkening the moon’s pale face. Shattered lanterns flickered in shallow alcoves, casting unsteady shadows upon chipped walls scrawled with half-faded runes. A hush blanketed the city, heavy and damp, as though every last voice had crouched beneath a table and held its breath. Beneath a leaning arch, I beheld a wizened matron kneeling in the gutter, gathering spilt grain kernels into a torn apron. Farther on, near a boarded house, a ragged dog pawed at the door, whining for a master who might never return. In that weighted silence, the smell of burning pitch and old regrets mingled in the thin mountain air.
With dawn’s ghostly approach, the defenders amassed atop the walls - those crumbling ramparts overlooking a yawning precipice. Worn faces, hollow from sleepless nights, glowed in the sickly half-light. strode among them, a living emblem of battered resolve, his gauntleted hand resting on the pommel of a sword marred by many campaigns. Some in the throng were bearded veterans with eyes like flint; others were mere apprentices, cheeks still ruddy with youth, anxiously gripping spear-shafts. My vantage lay behind the merlons of a broken tower, my heart drumming a frantic beat in my chest. Beneath me, the yawning drop promised a swift end if I grew careless. A cold wind snaked through the stones, stirring tatters of old banners. Then, from the distant gloom, came a horn’s low moan - a note that shivered through the soul like a raven’s cry at dusk.
So commenced the onslaught. First came the hammering at the gates - dull, concussive blows that set my teeth on edge. Twixt each strike, I heard the ragged breath of men upon the wall, the faint whimper of a youth trembling behind a shield. At last the timbers cracked, screaming in protest. A seething mass of shapes drove forward, black forms writhing as though a single monstrous body. Arrows whistled from the ramparts, a deadly rain that struck some beasts down, though many more lumbered on. Beneath the clarion calls of the defenders rose a swirl of savage roars, as though the very pit of nightmares had spewed forth. My mouth turned dry as old parchment.
By midday’s halflight - so feeble was the sun behind a pall of storm-clouds - the battered gates threatened collapse. signaled a retreat. “To the temple courtyard!” came the cry, echoed by every hoarse voice. Thus the defenders spilled into a great stone square once crowned by marble pillars carved with images of ancient victories. Alas, time had gnawed at those carvings until heroic visages were but faint outlines, and now the very courtyard itself lay strewn with rubble. Soldiers, artisans, and farmers alike pressed themselves behind broken walls, overturned carts, and the shattered stumps of statuary. Dust-laden motes drifted in the stale air. A hush fell - then the gates gave way entirely, and the foe flooded in.
Chaos unspooled in jagged ribbons. Sword met claw, spear bit met rabid maw. I glimpsed a woman in smith’s apron braining a twisted horror with a hammer blow, while a trembling youth, tears streaming, jabbed a broken halberd again and again into some slavering fiend. The stench of blood thickened the air, mingling with acrid smoke from braziers overturned in the fray. Still perched upon a fallen obelisk, I strove to note it all, my trembling quill set to memory, for I had neither skill nor nerve to join the clash.
Somewhere in that madness, ’s voice rang like a war horn.
“Stand, ye who cherish the morn! Let not the blackness devour what we hold dear!”
His blade, chipped and battered, blazed with each desperate strike. The defenders, rallying, locked shields and found fresh resolve. Yet the foe pushed ceaselessly, feeding upon fear. Stone pillars cracked further, dust raining down in choking billows. I expected each breath to be my last, so fiercely did my heart pound.
But as the sun drooped low behind grim clouds, the monstrous horde began to flag. Their onslaught lost cohesion, pressed back by the last shred of mortal bravery. With a series of shuddering roars, the black legion slunk away, leaving behind a courtyard strewn with the silent forms of friend and foe alike. Tattered banners lay in pools of gore. A hush spread, and in that hush I heard the ragged weeping of the living, the final sigh of the dying.
From behind a toppled column slid a small boy. Soot clung to his cheeks, and he clasped a wooden flute dear as though it were a relic of some beloved saint. He trod lightly past the remnants of a fallen statue - an arm, still pointing valiantly upward - until he reached , who knelt, armor punctured, blood trickling forth with each labored breath. The child raised a dented flask, offering water. A faint flicker of gratitude lit the general’s eyes. In that tiny exchange of compassion, the savage day softened.
So Redpeak yet endured. Some called it a miracle - others, the lingering cruelty of fate. The city lay half in ruin, rooftops caved where catapult stones had fallen, or where fires had licked unopposed for hours. Streets stank of smoke, death, and sorrow. Yet amid the desolation, folk gathered their dead with gentle reverence, an odd hush guiding their steps. I saw a mother cradle her child’s lifeless form while an old farmer rested his forehead against his battered shovel, tears cutting channels through the dust on his face. From these battered hearts, I sensed a spark still lived - a spark of defiance that refused to be quenched.
In time, I made my way to the keep, where watchers in dented helms guarded a door half-hanging from splintered hinges. Within, upon a makeshift bed of straw and soiled linens, lay propped against pillows, each breath measured like a blacksmith’s bellows nearing exhaustion. His eyes found mine, and a rasping chuckle emerged. “Thou again, fish-stenched vagabond?” quoth he, the mirth in his voice unbroken by pain.
I bowed in mock grandeur. “Thy vow, O general, is now the city’s shield. Illusions indeed, but illusions that hold men upright against the gloom.”
A battered sigh escaped him. “If illusions keep them from despair, let us call them truths.” Gently he touched the bandage round his shoulder. “I scarce believed I would see another morn. Perhaps we are all illusions, held together by faith alone.”
Thereafter, I wandered Redpeak’s battered courtyards, spinning the tale of that dreadful siege. Oft did I add comedic touches - my ill-fated tumble into fish brine, for instance - to stir some spark of laughter in the gloom. Children ringed me at dusk, wide eyes brimming with tearful awe. Soldiers with limbs in splints would nod wearily, as though my words were a salve upon their wounds. Meanwhile, old wives doled out broth from blackened pots, feeding those who had lost all. One might see, in each humble act, the forging of new illusions: illusions that tomorrow might yet dawn in kinder hues.
Gradually, Redpeak stitched itself from near-ruin. Women patched holes in sagging roofs using tar and scraps of sailcloth. Men hammered and bent broken swords into nails, reinforcing the gate with stubborn pride. Where plumes of smoke had scarred the sky, faint glimmers of sunlight now broke through. In the hollows of charred alleyways, cats prowled anew, searching for morsels of leftover stew. Such trifling sights might seem mundane, yet to the folk who had stared into the maw of annihilation, each meager sign of life was a benediction.
Eventually, my boots itched for the open road. On a dawn brightened by the faint glister of dew, I gathered my few belongings - chiefly a ragged satchel stuffed with scribbled notes - and, with a final glance to the keep’s tower, took my leave. From that high vantage, I saw watching me, leaning on a crutch. Our gazes met, wordless yet profound: we had witnessed how illusions could spark a city’s survival. Then I slipped through the battered gates, stepping onto a path that wound between stunted trees and rocky outcrops. Each breeze carried the tang of pine mingled with old smoke, a reminder that Redpeak was never far behind.
At every inn or roadside hearth thereafter, I shared the chronicle of Redpeak’s stand. Rubbing my hands over a cup of mulled wine, I would conjure the roars of the foe, the clangor of steel, the child’s flute, the battered general. Eyes would widen, hearts would pound in shared terror. But always, I ended with the vow: “Let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle...” Then came the hush - that sweet hush when illusions become a spark lighting human courage. Though the war roiled onward in far-flung fields, though horrors doubtless lurked beyond the horizon, I carried the vow in me like a flame in a lantern, guarded against the wind.
So may Redpeak endure, perched upon its cliff, illusions woven anew from small generosities. An orphan sharing a crust of bread, a blacksmith forging rivets from broken helm plates - these tiny deeds might not level armies, yet they keep hearts from sinking into the black mire of despair. Thus do illusions bridge the gulf that yawns between fear and hope.
Shouldst thou wander near Redpeak’s battered walls, recall the vow of General . Picture a child offering water to a warrior bowed by blood and exhaustion. Let it stir in thee the knowledge that illusions, shaped by humility and love, can outshine a thousand terrors. For each mortal life brims with hidden tales, each soul a tapestry of heartbreak and bravery. Illusions, indeed - yet illusions that harness the intangible might of faith, forging from them the very pillars that hold the darkness at bay.
Hence ends my telling. If thou findest me upon the king’s road, dust-laden cloak clinging to my shoulders and pockets clinking with battered dice, pray share with me a morsel of bread or a seat by the fire. For illusions, though wondrous, are best tended in the warmth of fellowship. Think on Redpeak, battered but unbroken, and let its vow echo in thine own heart when the creeping dark comes nigh. Who knows, dear friend, what single day of defiance might achieve? Let us gather illusions as we gather kindling in winter - so that our spirits burn ever bright against the beckoning night. 
To you I bid a most fond farewell. Cheers be unto you! For only in illusions must I speak.

I opened my eyes to gray shadows dancing lazily across the cracked ceiling, cast by curtains worn thin by age and neglect. A dull hum lingered from the corner, the air conditioning unit rattling softly, as if lamenting its futile effort. The sheets beneath me scraped gently against my skin, burlap masquerading as comfort, unnoticed except as a distant, abstract irritation.
Slowly, deliberately, I swung my legs over the edge of the bed, feet landing softly on cold floorboards that creaked in protest beneath my weight. The room was quiet, too quiet, except for that relentless hum. I glanced toward the wooden door, its paint peeling in curls, exposing scars of older colors beneath. Shadows hovered silently around its edges, patient and expectant.
I rose and moved across the room, each step measured and unhurried, hand reaching out toward the brass knob dulled by years of touch. My fingers curled around it; the metal felt cool, impersonal. Turning slowly, carefully, I allowed the door to swing inward. Darkness poured in smoothly, gliding up my hand, winding gently around my wrist, whispering silently along my arm and chest. It slipped inside effortlessly, entering through my eyes, my ears, my mouth, my nose - familiar, polite, but always distant. Always separate.
With a sigh that held no breath of feeling, I pushed the door closed, hearing the soft click of its latch. Returning to the bed, I paused before the worn armchair near the fireplace, its upholstery frayed, threads hanging loose in surrender. The fireplace itself lay cold and empty, long untouched by flame or warmth. A few charred logs sat haphazardly, covered in ash, waiting for nothing.
I settled into the chair, feeling the rough fabric press lightly against my back, staring at the shadowed fireplace as if waiting for something to emerge. A tale, perhaps. An old story from a childhood that felt as distant and fictional as the books gathering dust on shelves nearby. But nothing stirred. The silence around me deepened, accepting my quiet offering without response.
My gaze shifted back toward the door, its edges darkened by a presence lingering patiently. Unmoving, ever present. A polite visitor who required neither invitation nor dismissal. I turned my eyes away, resting them on my empty hands folded calmly in my lap.
Perhaps I was something of a Scrooge myself. Visited by specters in the quiet of the night, but unlike him, I hoarded apathy instead of wealth. My currency was numbness, an intangible treasure that accumulated quietly within, impossible to spend or share. No ghosts of past, present, or future could stir a heart frozen and unresponsive. Yet they came anyway, drawn to the silence, perhaps curious, perhaps just polite. They stood patiently, their hollow eyes fixed upon my stillness, their transparent hands extended toward emptiness. And still, I could offer nothing but quiet acknowledgment, no warmth or cold, just the unchanging neutrality of existence.
I had no more stories to tell. The quiet innkeeper within me had run dry, the bottles empty, the shelves bare. Yet, the shadow stayed, content in its own quiet, unwavering patience.
Perhaps, I mused idly, this was what immortality felt like - a silent, endless sitting with nothing left to share, nothing left to feel, just shadows dancing gently at the edges of perception.
My hands remained still, calm and empty. The cup ran over, and yet no one drank.
I suppose it is time to make myself immortal.

The world wakes up and cries out as a chorus of voices longing for that which they do not have. All the plants open their pores and all the animals move under the canopy. The smell washes over the earth as water from the sky does the ground. It permeates the earth, a percolating peat-smelling perfume. It is nature’s quiet exhale tangled in mineral echoes. It lingers softly, spun from the breath of stone and the ghostly sighs of forgotten rain. Hints of time-worn moss and the enigmatic sweetness of renewal intermingle, a scent crafted by ephemeral alchemy. You might catch it just once, fleeting as a whispered verse, leaving your soul nostalgic for something you've always known but never truly named. It is that which hugs you as you cuddle inside under a blanket. It is that which accompanies the resounding patter of heavenly tears upon asphalt. It is that which cradles the hands of earth and sky as they clasp together once again, joyously reunited after so long. It is that which coaxes from the stones a million tiny memories of its last passing - bringing with it the cleansing and beautiful melody of that life-giving ichor. Neither flower nor flame, yet blooming incandescently nonetheless, it hints at something antique yet newborn - like the breath of a sleeping deity stirred momentarily awake. An aromatic palindrome, it moves backward and forward through sensation, leaving only echoes to puzzle your curiosity, inviting you to guess at the intangible essence that gently, insistently, haunts the edges of recognition. Sometimes brought with wind keener than the keenest blade contrived or softer than a saber’s precise drive. So it is, so again it will be. Tomorrow and again and again the next.

Where ARE the boots that marched so bold?
 In bronze they trod, once proud and strong;
 They lie in dust, their story told,
 And hush recalls in shadows’ song.

Where lies the cloak once richly dyed?
 The purple tint now fades to gray;
 Its golden threads once gently cried,
 Beneath regrets now tucked away.

Where lies the goblet, gilt with gold?
 Its silver tarnished, wine all gone;
 Lost echoes tell of feasts untold,
 As ghosts of mirth now sigh undone.

Where lies the armor, strength it bore?
 The shield lies shattered, emblem gone;
 The lion’s prowl shall rise no more,
 A silent ward on fields forlorn.

Where rests the book whose pages blur?
 Salt-stained, each line with trembling hand;
 “Forgive me,” wafts the whispered whir,
 As tears of ink bleed on the sand.

Where lie the embers, once so sweet?
 Their fragrant bloom consumed by gloom;
 No woodsmoke warms these hands we greet,
 A chill enshrouds this hollow room.

Where stands the hourglass, cracked with care?
 Its grains lie still, the course undone;
 In frozen time, it hangs in air,
 These moments fall beneath no sun.

Where hangs the portrait, gaze afar?
 Its colors pale, once scarlet bled;
 Those eyes, they searched some distant star,
 Now faded forms in dreams have fled.

Gone, gone, the echoes sound so deep,
 Dim relics haunt with sorrow’s weight;
 Here still they linger, drowned in sleep,
 Remembered shades, forsaken fate.

Ink and tears upon the sand.

Where embers cold, their scent once sweet,
Lavender lost in ashen gloom?
Woodsmoke's warmth no more to greet,
Chill pervades this empty room.

Where the hourglass, cracked with care,
Grains unmoved, its course undone?
Frozen time, suspended there,
Moments stilled beneath no sun.

Where the portrait, gaze afar,
Colors faded, scarlet bled?
Eyes that sought some distant star,
Faces pale, their dreams long fled.

Gone, gone, the echoes deep,
Silent relics, sorrow-laden;
Here they linger, lost in sleep,
Memories of the forsaken.

There is a little homunculus under my bed.
Born of blood and fear and love.
It’s in a little dog crate.
I raised it as a devout catholic.
Sometimes I’ll poke it with a stick
When I want a prayer answered.
And the little homunculus will clasp its grubby paws
And the little homunculus will gaze up to the sky
And the little homunculus will chant some latin
And the little prayers are always heard.
Because the little homunculus has never known sin.
I remember how we’d lie together on the floor of my room. Just chatting, platonically, of course. You’d have your feet kicked up on my windowsill and I’d have my back to the wall. You were wearing Adidas sweatpants and a white and blue t-shirt. I was probably wearing a cardigan and cargo pants. The rest of our friends had just left. They had been hanging out and we had played D&D. Your hands were likely still fidgeting with your dice. They were cool, being metal and all that. You were still here and would spend the night like you usually did. You’d stretch out on the couch and I’d sleep on a beanbag. We wouldn’t really sleep, just talk. I would wish for you to maybe just reach behind you and put your hand on mine. Maybe just take one step farther than we were both comfortable with. That wouldn’t happen though. That was okay, I like to think so much of our tension came of so much unrequited love. So we’d stay up late and talk. You’d tell me about this cool character concept you had and I’d tell you about this girl I’d fallen for. You’d tell me about your crush and I’d give you advice. Ultimately the advice didn’t work, and it really made it look like I had cheated when it was all said and done. I had never meant for it to be that way, I am sorry I wasn’t there for you more when it all fell apart. I still remember that night when we took the RTD train back from that show; Happy birthday.
You were the first person who made me question what friendship was supposed to feel like. I think I knew, even then, that I loved you more than you loved me. You were my best friend, but I always felt like I was just another person to you - someone you enjoyed being around, but not someone you needed. I wanted so badly to hear you say otherwise, to tell me I was the person you’d call first with good news, or the one you’d turn to when everything felt like it was falling apart. Instead, I watched you laugh with other people, watched you prioritize them in ways you never did with me. I tried to convince myself that I was being paranoid, overthinking something that didn’t need to be so complicated. 
Maybe I should have fought harder to stay loyal to the fragile connection we still had. I didn’t, though. I left you, not alone, but I left you. You kept your Logan and I kept mine. I’ll never forget the way you looked at me when everything finally ended. There was no anger in us by the end, just a quiet disappointment in both of us that I’ll carry with me forever. You didn’t have to say anything for me to know that I’d lost you completely. But I believe the exact words you used were:
”Arrogant, narcissistic, sociopathic cunt.” How tasteful. I am sorry, I was stupid, but I know I was not wrong.
I am known by all the people who I’ve hurt. I know all of them too. I still think of you every time I play D&D, your character is still referenced occasionally. I wonder if you’re in the same spot as me - struggling to enjoy a major you know you want to do. Finance, right? I still think of you every time I worry about my own future - trying to become someone successful like my dad - or your dad. I think of the nights we spent driving on I-70 way beyond a safe speed and the nights I spent sitting in your house watching your dogs while you were away on a trip. I still reread the messages you used to send me, some are lovely and some are brutal. Why did you have to be so threatening when it all ended? Why couldn’t it die with ice instead of fire? I still listen to your playlists when I’m sad, you always had a knack for making playlists that you could be miserable with.

You remain near home, counting the days until college no doubt.
You were so far away for so long.
I had finally stopped exploring when I found you.
I pride myself on reading people.
The discerning reader may find that cliche.
I disagree.
You could not be read. I still don’t understand you.
From the beginning I was intrigued, allured, and enraptured.
It’s remarkable. I aspire to be as you are.
You’ll never know how much you inspired me.
And the cruel joke of it is that every time I was dismissed.
And I loved it. I’m never dismissed.
I met you at junior prom, well, not really. I saw you there. You saw me too, but only in the way the sun sees the stars. The sun could love all the stars in the sky, yes, but never as an equal. We each thought about talking to one another but that would be silly. You hate me. 
I’ve known you since third grade. We’d sit on the sidelines of my younger brother's little league soccer and I would be reading a book like I often did as a kid. Something with dragons and knights and wizards and magic. You’d strut up, sassy as always and tell me I was a slow reader. I was the faster reader, but I went along with it because we liked the same books and it was an excuse to keep talking. You’d always get bored of talking though so we’d kick around a soccer ball. We played lots of little soccer games, you won those more often than not. Our parents always joked that “one day we’d get married” but that quickly stopped when our brothers stopped playing soccer together in 5th grade. I didn’t see you after that for a long time, I was going to a different middle school than you. I would see you again though, there was only one high school in our little town. By the time high school rolled around everyone thought we were going to be awfully competitive. You were smart, quick-witted, and had a reputation among your peers as being incredibly argumentative. You were the girl in school who took all AP, was motivated, and had a reputation for being a bit hard to work with. I took all AP too, and I always did better than you. I suppose it must have hurt your self-esteem a little when I got perfect grades without once having to study. So I was valedictorian, you were 5th. You spread rumors that I was an idiot and somehow must be cheating to be that good. I suppose even in high school you found a way to call me a slow reader.
Now, all of this is to say, you weren’t fond of me. And even though we (somehow) never ended up in a class together, I always thought it was touching that you dedicated so much time to “orchestrating” my “academic downfall”. At least that’s what your friend called it. Sometimes I wonder if you were too competitive for your own good. 
I’m still not entirely sure how it happened, but it seems that around junior prom you had finally caved to the peer pressure to download Snapchat (a choice most high schoolers were facing at that junction) and since I used it I imagine I must have added you. Weirdly, we had started to talk over Snapchat - normal talking. Nothing rude, well, okay, a little rude. But then you did the most inexplicable unexpected wildly delusional thing - you asked me out. I think it was just for ice cream - there was a new place that had just opened up near our houses - so out we went.
You taught me to love the risks of life, but only because I was so safe for you. We went to concerts and parties and late nights with your friends. Your parents never approved but they didn’t have to know. They just loved me. Me and my good grades and my witty banter. Someone who would always debate them and talk to them. Someone they could invite over to dinner without even a hint of embarrassment. They’ve known me since 3rd grade after all. You liked that too. You liked how your parents trusted me with you, and so they trusted you more too. So out we’d go, doing stupid highschool things like stupid highschool students. My life became just that for a while: a polysyndeton push/pull of moment to moment to moment risk. So no wonder I fell out of love when you just wanted to use me to stay free from your parents. Some sort of two-faced straight-laced night-wild boyfriend.
I still remember those late nights though, but I don’t think I want to go back. Babysitting you while you were drunk and in love started to wear on me. But the way you’d stare into my eyes while we’d stand outside at Red Rocks. The way the stone rose up around us like a great red hand clasping at the sky and cradling us as the music played. I’d wrap myself in your arms like you were a blanket and I’d watch you as you’d speak to me.
“D’you think my parents are gonna be mad?”
“I don’t think so, love.”
“Are you gonna drive us home?”
“Yes, love.”
“Is it late?”
“Just a little bit, love.”
“I’m sorry”
“Don’t be sorry, love.”
“Do you feel alright?”
“Jubilant, love.”
I am known by all the people who have hurt me. I know all of them too. I keep the book of flower pictures you made me in my bedside drawer. I wear the shirt you got me at the Arctic Monkeys concert when we really didn’t have a single care in the world. Our brothers play soccer together again, I hear the team is doing pretty good. I still chat with your parents on the sideline when I visit. They’re still happy to see me, despite your best wishes. Every time I drive by your family's bookstore I always look to see if your car is parked on the side of the road where I remember it being. Every day I wear the little ring you gave me, the one with the little moons that waxed and waned again and again and again.

Upon the page in ebony
I spoke of them in words so tall.
With hair like flowing locks of gold,
With eyes prismatic emerald.
Where there we had a deepened sense
of onyx thoughts so tenderly
That I’d lay down and die that day
In casket of chalcedony.
We watched the sunset from your bed
With starry garnished garnet shade.
I spoke to you of flowers dead
My soul lit zircon where we lay.
I met you in October, on the 3rd week of Ms. Brim’s AP world history class, at the second table in the back left of the room. Yet I first knew you in November. I remember the bangs you had that sat on your face right above your eyes. I remember the cat hoodie you wore and the beat up converse shoes. These aren’t really what I remember though. It started with that first time we went hiking up in Alderfer. We climbed up the tall rocks that sat in the center of the park and I held your hand as you pulled me up the last cliff. You learned I was terrified of heights then. That was when you began to know me.
We sat in the parking lot for hours afterwards listening to music in my car and talking about anything. I’ve always struggled with small talk since then. It wasn’t ever really the same. The jubilant feeling of being loved, unfortunately, cannot exist without the horrifying finality of being known. There is no connection that can come of anything but an open heart. 
That Christmas, I spent the time at your house. The first time I wasn’t home with my family. You climbed up onto the bannister to the left of the spiral staircase in the living room. Your hands felt around behind you, grabbing the windowsill as you stood almost ten feet above me in the air. I told you not to fall. As if that mattered. You fell anyway. Although not from the bannister. Your hands slowly reached up and put the ornament I gave you up on the Christmas tree. A little chimera suspended on sterling silver string. Higher up than anything else. I told you just to focus on climbing. Don’t look at me, don’t look at me Orpheus. You made your way back down and I caught you as you fell on the last couple stairs - so close to making it down unscathed. Don’t look at me. So close to making it down without slipping. I never saw that bannister again. I never saw that Christmas tree. But what was there to complain of? Eurydice had been loved, to love someone you will look at them anyways. God! The way you’d always complain that my writing got too meta, the way you’d always tell me to keep doing it.
When you looked back at me, I felt like you saw who I really was. You really knew me. At that time, I felt I was loved. I still remember all the little dates we went on with Logan - she had never liked third wheeling but she liked us. All those late nights spent ice skating when we were the only people there and I felt like the night would never end. I knew you. I know the way your eyes would tear up whenever you stood too fast and the way your ears would turn bright red when you were embarrassed. Your cats are named Sage, Midnight, and Buttercup - Butter always liked me more than you. I know your favorite cereal is “Frosted Mini-Wheats” and the first time you tried it was at a hotel in California when you were 8. I know how you struggled to stand out in orchestra since viola players never got major roles, you became section leader anyways. I know that when you called me perfect you really just meant good because nobody had ever brought you flowers before. Hydrangeas were always your favorite by the way.
I am known by all the people who have loved me. I know all of them too. I’m always overjoyed whenever I see another viola player take the spotlight - you always said they never got enough representation. I still make your tortilla soup recipe every Christmas Eve. Tomorrow I’m flying halfway across the country to see a Saint Motel concert, a band you showed me on our first date. I still remember. I listen to your playlists with wired earbuds, you always said Bluetooth had no “romance”. The blanket you gave me when I was sick, sits on the end of my dorm bed - three years later - more comfortable than any comforter. You were right, I am a sucker for a good meta-narrative. You’re gone from my life but now I write beautiful words to immortalize the joy you’ve given me. I put thoughts to words so I don’t forget, your memory becoming the mythology I allude to in my own writing. I hope I never forget your voice, dear muse, but I fear I already have.

By 
A day I sought to make a poem,
I took the pencil in my hand.
I folded scroll and sorrow song,
I laid it out upon the sand.
The beast its ugly head had reared
With dreaded thought I fought it back,
With push and pull - grim errantry
Entreat my soul to crimson black. 
The sun had risen heliod
Upon the ocean’s hazy hue.
I sat and wrote for hour more–
Upon the shore I smote its ruin.
Eradication stationed here
Procrastinating writer’s block.
Elucidation coming close,
My heart had fluttered under lock.
I held the notebook sapphire blue,
The pen of color ruby red,
The fountain point a sharpened blade
Where thoughts to home and hearth had fled.
Upon the page in ebony
I spoke of her in words so tall.
Her hair like flowing locks of gold,
Her eyes prismatic emerald.
Remember in November then
When loving seemed so far away
When juniors we had just become
When I would seek you every day.
We trekked in wood on rocks we climbed,
I knew you were the one for me.
As time with you had drifted by
I simply faltered happily.
We shared in music, art, and math–
in nerdy things we both pursued
the polymathic classic case
of everything I did peruse.
I was scared I cared for you
more than what you did for me
but every day you did assure
that you had tried to care for me.
There we had a deepened sense
of onyx thoughts so tenderly
That I’d lay down and die that day
In casket of chalcedony.
We watched the sunset from your bed
With starry garnished garnet shade.
I spoke to you of flowers dead
My soul lit zircon where we lay.
Mosaic’s you had made in me–
a gifted guided sculptors hand.
You cried in arms of mine at night
tears melting glass out of the sand.
Your sweater smelled of lilac sage,
Your hand was guided to the ground.
The consonance and consequence
And assonance frolicked around.
Late that day we went to yours,
I saw your parents there with He.
the changer of your mind had wrought
discordant plots of symphony.
Your parents asked me how I was
I told to them some diamond truths,
Your dad had asked what I would do
his tongue bitter with sweet vermouth.
Your cats crept underfoot aware
that there they could be loved by two
of opal eyes alight with joy –
joining eyes that looked at you.
That night the sun had set again
and topaz beams had settled by,
with love I touched you on your head,
with love I gazed into your eyes.
Had I known what you would do
I would not have simplified:
The words I said should have been caught,
I’d let you know I’m terrified.
So please remember that I cared,
So please remember that I lost
the part of me I gave to you
down below the winter’s frost.
A poet of quite quiet cold
With slanting rhymes my heart to fill.
In winter now I write some more
Sitting upon my windowsill.
A windless winter blew my way
spineless did it in darkness creep
With wings of silk and soft and day
its ilk brought death and suffering.
Muffled cries of painless sorrow
‘morrow day could not be mourned.
In knowing what I sought to find
my self and soul I found I spurned.
Of days from that old crooked year
I wrote not of the jubilance,
At once the joy I used to sing
I gazed in sad exuberance.
I know you’re here, the monster slain
I long to not forget your voice.
The trees are cold and soft and gray.
Please make not hard my wicked choice.
Remember when we skated ‘round
the lake by our forgotten homes?
Our gloves pulled tight our hats worn down,
Idle thoughts within our phones.
That day in class you held my hand,
to sand of beach I did return,
A moment of lucidity.
You did to me a ruthless burn
discerning not what it would do.
What portent prayer it’d require,
you’d done not more horror to me,
You’d baptized me in holy fire.
You called me late that night at home
When sleep to me could never fall.
Fallen leaves around me drifted
When then my sorrow soul was called.
A day will come when I forget
As stars out over us will wheel,
Cosmic insignificance,
This poem will be just how I’ll feel.

I dream of hopeless romances and evening dances and nights spent out on the town.
I dream of life filled with struggle and strife but one where I pull through.
But best of all, within this song, you’ll find a simple truth.
Not one single word from here on - at all - involves you.
Talking improper I offer a proposition, a rightful inquisition
A frightful delightful insightful conversation
Matching our wits in the dark (for the most part)
Red wine, sublime - The life I want from you.
Streets of europe, you’re up, make it true.
I never really had this, I wanted it
But thing about wants is life stops it
And makes you wish it hadn’t flaunted it.
I’ve never met someone like you,
You make me feel a hope,
Make me a helpless allotrope 
That is selfless, thinking about less
I wish it’s real but nope, can we elope yet?
Damn.
The cobblestones I wander I ponder
And think, about fonder times - 
A happier day away from the voices
That tell me I can’t make my choices
I’ll never be happy.
I know, I won’t.
But if you’re real…
Reach out, let me know.
I blow every candle wishing for you
To take me home, my bones
Grow older, not bolder every day
Charisma fades away (it’s okay)
I’ve forgotten how to play
To live, laugh and love
There’s no more white dove.
I can’t think of how many futures I’ve promised
Dishonest I know, but you go
You tell me how to live right, without fright
Every night I wonder if i’m half-right
But the thing about fright-ening shit
Is it’s the unenlightening shit that’s
Really the heightening shit
You said let’s “do it together”
Whether or not we weather the weathering
Storm, endeavouring to spend my days bettering
Myself, and fettering my dreams
Around the place, you hurt me, don’t desert me
Oh wait, you did.
Real life isn’t poetic, but it’s the aesthetic
The ascetic, phonetic flow it’s kinetic,
Sounds stupid. I know.
And I quote: “If it’s an optimist you seek I’ll speak of hope”
The sorta words that fill your heart with ecstasy and plunge it into fire
Higher and higher every day
Balancing on a wire, tireless
Until it goes away. I’ll find a way
I’ll say, “I love you, if I may”
Your first text to me was “huh”
Well, uhhh, that's strange.
The human experience can encompass
Only so much, my columbus, I stand
with a compass from a stranger, 2000 miles away.
I promised this wouldn’t be about you, but it is.
You gave me everything I needed, without you, I’d be dead.
A hopeless emotional wreck.
A tiny speck.
Of life in a universe that cares not
About a lot that takes its spot i never
Really wrought a conclusion
From the fires of existence.
Would it be great if you never got so distant
Your light is getting dimmer, the world is none the wiser.
Hey, long time no talk - care to take a little walk?

Nothing scares me more than the fact the I might become ugly to the person who told me all the stars were in my eyes
Nothing scares me more than the fact the solid black line I once had becomes more gray by the day.
I wish to cast off the veil of parting that envelopes me and send into its darkness all of the light I have within me.
Another day dawns and I still forget who I trust and what I want and how I love and where I am and why I’m here and when it will all end.
If I am to give you my sorrows then I must wholly have all that you are and I must drink of it like a desert in a rainstorm.
I have so much for you, and I can’t have it because it’s not mine and I can’t give it to anyone because it’s yours and it’s all yours.
I seek not to become anything but merely unbecome what I am not, to unbecome all that is unbecoming of me.
There is a great triumph in crashing when you should be soaring and falling through the sun-laced sky painted gold.
It is your greatest privilege to find me utterly incomprehensible and I wish most sincerely that I haunt you.
There is such great grief in knowing I cannot be every version of myself that I know to be inside my heart and soul.
My life is like a lithobraking maneuver heading to a negative periapsis and I am ablative and covered in engine rich exhaust.
If you want to cook you may burn down the house and if you want to play then wreck all my furniture and if it is art you want then tear it all up.
One day you will be older and waving goodbye to your best friend and you’ll never know that was the last time you’d talk.
You will think about how long the days were and how you could have held their hand if you had just tried to do it.
They are beautiful and you will one day be struck by it in all its grand vicissitudes and minute details and you will be still for a moment.
Please stay for another cup of tea my dear, the days are so short and getting shorter and you are so lovely.
You are not a monster but a monster is not such a bad thing, it is merely a messenger of catastrophe and a lighthouse all the same.
There are a hundred Eskimo words for snow and a hundred Egyptian words for sand but the way you take my hand and rub your thumb, there are not words for that.

By the little drawer with the tea sat a table
Books sat there
My wax seal
A couple mugs
A box full of letters
A jar full of notes
A drawer full of flavorful readily brewable motes
Black tea for you
My mom always green
I had the rooibos
My friends had no tea
Sometimes the mint
Only when I was sick
I’d crawl out of bed
crawl to the corner
crawl to the kettle
flip the lever
crawl back to bed
let my tea steep
by the little drawer with the tea
it wasn’t cheap
I had tea from Istanbul, Cape Town
Tea from London and Kenya
Tea from my dad who’d travel
unraveling little bags
sometimes loose leaf
Tea from Japan, Mongolia
Sometimes Peru
A little drawer full of tea
Gifts from all of you
I’d sit on my window
reading my books
I’d sip on my tea
you’d give me those looks
of quiet apprehension
”do you like it?”
I hope so
I do like it
I love my little drawer with the tea
I love all of its stories
packages of colorful tea and its glories

You're sharper than a knife can slice, 
Swifter than a sword’s device. 
Stronger than a bow at draw, 
Because you leave me in utter awe. 
If your sharpness were a blade to wield, 
No armor forged could form a shield. 
It’d shatter steel, cut straight and true, 
And cleave my heart clean through and through. 
If a blade were as sharp as you are grand, 
It’d split at the touch of its own hand. 
If my heart could match your endless might, 
I’d live unbroken, day and night. 
If my thoughts could move as quick as you, 
I'd turn the world with words anew. 
If my travels were as fast as your fire, 
The path would end at my desire. 
If I burned as fierce as you inspire, 
I’d crumble to ash in my own pyre. 
The air would vanish from my chest, 
For space would hold your strength at rest. 
It’d fill the skies, the stars, the moon, 
And I can’t wait to see you soon. 

“Nonsense”

In passion’s ashen twisted despair,
So it returnéd with hate in its heart.
I was invested the moment you were involved,
How the silence keeps you company.
The way the light fell when she was gone.
Biting battling bone-wide boreholes
Protected from darkness that creeps.
Sanctity! Judge, jury, and executioner.
Memories drift like whispers on the breeze,
When you are simply left with the silence between the stars.
simply plotting idle letters, scattered…
Just to call themself a person in this tense.
A windless winter blew my way
Softly slowly slumbering down.
You fell anyway.
With Autumns of laughter, winters of gall,
It’s beyond its woven war torn castle walls.
time reframed by the edge of your laughter,
Catching life like a cold, or something viral.
The way her breath turned sharp at dawn,
of a hasty headstrong youth heading.
Sometimes the thoughts hit me violently.
Heresy! Blaspheme out the maker?
Reason grapples with a restless tide,
And the grey veil of parting envelopes all that is,
Infinite monkeys on infinite keyboards
Polite smiles hide what’s grim,
Muffled cries of painless sorrow
But what was there to complain of?

The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon

Belief isn't simply a thing for fair times and bright days...What is belief - what is faith - if you don't continue in it after failure?...Anyone can believe in someone, or something that always succeeds...But failure...ah, now, that is hard to believe in, certainly and truly. Difficult enough to have value. Sometimes we just have to wait long enough...then we find out why exactly it was that we kept believing...There's always another secret.

And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived

Somehow, we'll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be. But for now, we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.

I try to avoid having thoughts. They lead to other thoughts, and—if you’re not careful—those lead to actions. Actions make you tired. I have this on rather good authority from someone who once read it in a book.

He saw it in her eyes. The anguish, the frustration. The terrible nothing that clawed inside and sought to smother her. She knew. It was there, inside. She had been broken. 
Then she smiled. Oh, storms. She smiled anyway. 
It was the single most beautiful thing he’d seen in his entire life.

Why hasn't anyone killed him yet?”
“Dumb luck,” Wit said. “In that I’m lucky you’re all so dumb.

Yes, I began my journey alone, and I ended it alone. 
But that does not mean that I walked alone.

How remarkable, if you spend your life knocking people down, you eventually find they won't stand up for you. There’s poetry in that, don’t you think?

I will not lie by saying every day will be sunshine. But there will be sunshine again, and that is a very different thing to say. That is truth. I promise you, you will be warm again.

“Thinking is a dangerous pastime”

City folk, particularly politicians, were intimidated by small arms. They preferred to kill people with more modern weapons, like poverty and despair.

You are whatever you want to be. You're the wind. You're the stars. You are all endless things

Act 1
(Verse 1)
GIRL:
(Singing softly, melancholic)
"I’ll never find joy, it seems out of reach,
In whispers and dreams, you silently teach.
Each candle blown out, still wishing for you,
To guide me back home, as years they accrue.

(Chorus)
(Increasing intensity, a mix of hope and despair)
Charisma fades, it's slipping away,
Forgotten the play, the light of the day.
No doves in the sky, just clouds hanging low,
Promises lie, where did the truth go?

(Verse 2)
(Reflective, introspective)
You preach of a life, free of the fear,
Each night I wonder, if the answer is near?
In shadows and doubts, the fright takes its hold,
Unenlightened thoughts, in whispers so cold.

(Bridge)
(Faster pace, a hint of anger and frustration)
“You said 'together', through storms, we'd endeavor,
To better our days, in so many ways.
But you left me here, in silence, in tears,
Real life's not a song, but pain lingers on.

(Chorus)
(Sorrowful, longing)
The words that you spoke, of hope and of dreams,
Lifted me high, then tore at the seams.
On a wire I stand, in a tireless land,
Waiting for you, to reach out your hand.

(Verse 3)
(Speaking, a direct address, as if to an unseen figure)
Your first word to me, just a simple 'huh',
Strange as it seems, it was enough.
From miles away, a stranger's decree,
A compass you gave, in a world lost at sea.

(Bridge)
(Softly, a sense of realization)
I said not of you, but here we are,
You were my north star, from near and from far.
In a universe cold, uncaring, unkind,
You were the story, in my mind.

(Outro)
(Slow, fading)
Hey, long time no talk, let's take a walk,
In dreams, in the dark, you were my spark.
[Girl gets into bed, the lights dim. Stage transition.]
[Scene: Split stage. On one side, GRANDMOTHER sits at a desk, writing a letter. On the other, GIRL is in her room, surrounded by mundane life. A sense of longing and distance is evident.]
[Doorbell rings]
POSTMAN: Hey, letter for you.
GIRL: Thanks…
[Girl walks over to her desk and opens the letter]
GIRL: Grandma? Why in the world would she write to me… I haven’t heard from her since I was a kid. 
(Verse 1 - GRANDMOTHER)
GRANDMOTHER:
(Singing softly, with warmth)
I know its been a while…
I know that I’ve been distant
But let me explain -

(Verse 1 - GIRL)
GIRL:
(Reading the letter, curious and reflective)
-But how? Why now?
Why reach out and try?
When they died, you weren’t standing by!
GRANDMOTHER:
Just join me in the country
Just join me upstate?
Just please come visit
Just spend a moment, I pray

Trust me I know
Oh I know,
I know what loss is
It’s touched my heart

[Stage Direction: GIRL begins to pace, contemplating. GRANDMOTHER looks out the window, hopeful.]
GIRL:
Why reach out now when the going gets tough?
Every missed birthday or christmas wasn’t enough?
Even through struggle, trouble and pain
I’ve fought and earned my own life in my lane.
[Now simultaneous]
GRANDMOTHER:
Just join me in the country
Join me upstate?
Just please come visit
Spend a moment, I pray

GIRL
10 years of loneliness
10 years to wait
10 years now to visit?
Why must you be this way?

(Chorus - Both)
GRANDMOTHER & GIRL:
(harmonizing)
Maybe they’re hurting like me
It’s a short journey upstate anyway
So many years, 

GIRL: Guess I’m going upstate.
[Stage Direction: GIRL starts to pack a bag, still singing. GRANDMOTHER folds the letter, sending it with a wish.]

(Verse 2 - GRANDMOTHER)
GRANDMOTHER:
(Singing with a hint of sadness)
"Years slipped away, in silence,
Wilted lilies, roses and violence.
My home to share, with love and care,
For you, my grandchild, I want to be there."

(Verse 2 - GIRL)
GIRL:
(Singing with a mix of hope and uncertainty)
"Could this be a sign, to change the line,
Of a life that's been, less than divine?
With each packed attire, grows a new fire,
To find the love, I deeply desire."

[Stage Direction: GIRL finishes packing. She takes a deep breath, ready for a new journey.]

Add dialoge here

[Stage Direction: GIRL exits her room, the stage transitions to show her journey.]

(Outro - GIRL)
GIRL:
(Arriving at GRANDMA'S door, singing with newfound determination)
"Here at your door, I stand with awe,
A new chapter, in life's raw draw.
Grandma, I'm here, with hope and fear,
In your world, let's make it clear."

[End of song. GIRL knocks on the door. Lights fade as GRANDMA opens it, welcoming her.]
Scene: Grandmother's living room. The atmosphere is tense and charged. GRANDMA sits anxiously as GIRL enters, her demeanor guarded and resentful.

(Verse 1 - GRANDMA)
GRANDMA:
(Singing, with a mix of desperation and regret)
"Welcome, child, to this silent house,
A home of echoes, as quiet as a mouse.
My heart's been aching, in these rooms so bare,
Longing for a kin, someone to care."
Add “respectless” intro to intro of this song?
(Verse 1 - GIRL)
GIRL:
(Singing, with evident anger and confusion)
"Arriving here, a stranger in your den,
Years of absence, where were you then?
Your silence, a chasm, deep and wide,
Why reach now, why turn the tide?"

[Stage Direction: GIRL’s body language shows her frustration. GRANDMA’s expression is one of pain and regret.]

(Chorus - Both)
GRANDMA & GIRL:
(Singing, voices filled with emotion)
"Generations clash, in this shared space,
A storm of feelings, we're face to face.
Words unspoken, now rising like a wave,
In this welcome, can we be brave?"

[Stage Direction: GRANDMA reaches out, but GIRL steps back, maintaining her distance.]

(Verse 2 - GRANDMA)
GRANDMA:
(Singing, her voice breaking)
"In this quiet home, I've drowned in guilt,
Walls have witnessed, the life I've built.
A chance to reconcile, too late to seize?
In my twilight years, I beg you, please."

(Verse 2 - GIRL)
GIRL:
(Singing, with a mix of sorrow and bitterness)
"An offer made, in my darkest hours,
A gesture too late, now turns sour.
Where were you in my time of despair?
A belated reach, does it show you care?"

[Stage Direction: The emotional gap between them is palpable. GIRL’s words hang heavily in the air.]

(Bridge - Both)
GRANDMA & GIRL:
(Singing, their voices intertwining with raw emotion)
"In this tense air, can we find a path,
To heal these wounds, to calm the wrath?
A bridge to cross, in this night so long,
In our welcome, can we be strong?"

[Stage Direction: GIRL turns away, her emotions simmering. GRANDMA watches her, torn between reaching out and holding back.]

(Outro - GIRL)
GIRL:
(Singing, as she retreats to her room)
"Goodnight in a house where secrets dwell,
In dreams perhaps, we’ll break this spell.
I retire now, in your home, awake,
In this welcome night, our truths at stake."

[End of song. GIRL exits to her room, leaving GRANDMA alone in her sorrow. The lights dim to signify the end of the scene.]

Scene: A quaint bedroom at night. GIRL is asleep. An old-fashioned radio crackles to life, casting a dim glow. The atmosphere is filled with a sense of intrigue and nostalgia.
(Intro - RADIO) RADIO: (Speaking in a charismatic 1920s radio announcer style) "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, tuning in from the realm of dreams and shadows. We've got a special broadcast tonight… 
a tale of yesteryear and today, intertwined in the most curious of ways.
The observant viewer notes the parallel, takes care to tell
that no matter whether you endeavor or not, you never know your final days!
(Verse 1 - RADIO) (Speaking, with a hint of mystery) 
Here in the quiet of this slumbering room emerges a story from the gloom
Parents died in a crash abandoning her to the world, life swirled down the drain
The observant viewer notes the parallel, takes care to tell
that no matter whether you endeavor or not, you never know your final days!
[Stage Direction: The radio's glow intensifies slightly. GIRL shifts in her sleep, as if sensing the presence.]
(Narrative - RADIO) (Speaking, with a touch of nostalgia) "
Ah, the threads of time, how they connect a lineage, more intricate than one might expect
In the hush of the night, through the hum of this set, she hears echoes of family, handily
No matter whether you endeavor or not, you never know your final days!
[Stage Direction: The ambiance of the room shifts subtly, reflecting the radio's influence.]
(Monologue - RADIO) (Speaking, with an air of enigma) "Now, don't be alarmed, dear listener in the night. This voice you hear, it’s not here to cause fright. Just a humble narrator, from an era long gone, watching over this scene, as the night moves along."
[Stage Direction: GIRL seems to react to the words in her sleep, her expression one of faint recognition.]
(Outro - RADIO) (Speaking softly, fading out) 
So rest easy for now, let the night carry on. 
But remember this visit when the morning light dawns. 
From the heart of the airwaves, to your dreams, I alight. This is your friendly broadcaster, signing off for the night.
The observant viewer notes the parallel, takes care to tell
that no matter whether you endeavor or not, you never know your final days!
[End of song. The radio clicks off, the light dims, leaving the room in a peaceful darkness. GIRL continues to sleep, the air of mystery lingering.]

Away - receives letter from estranged grandmother asking if she’d want to come live with her. This scene would have the grandmother sing to narrate the letter and Girl would sing her thoughts. They’d be split on opposite parts of the stage. As the song progresses Girl would begin to get ready for travel and the song would end with her at Grandmas door.
Welcome - grandma explains her own loneliness and Girl listens and some sort of age conflict as well as the girl being annoyed grandma didn’t reach out. The song ends with Girl in bed.
I know you - a crackling radio turns on, we hear what is first unintelligible radio static and then eventually a “is this thing on? Haha! We have broadcast!”. This radio voice begins to sing about how there is something familiar about this girl in bed. Chorus is “another of the family line” or something.
It’s a deal then? - the girl wakes up to the now quiet but still crackling radio. As she goes towards it, it gets louder. She hits it a few times before turning around to the presence of Radio. She screams but radio begins to explain how nobody can hear her. The song is about Radio offering her a deal for happiness, the only cost is her eternal soul if she fails to become happy. Later in the play, when’s she’s at her lowest, Radio reveals he never wanted her soul and inspires her to set things right. Song ends with so, “it’s a deal then?”. Then quiet as Radio leaves and the girl is left in silence.
In my day - Grandma lectures her the next morning reflecting typical boomer ideals of tough it up, etc and saying that girl is lazy. This ignores the obvious issue that grandma is lonely but that isn’t revealed yet. The song ends with Girl walking away in rage.
Stay Tuned - Girl is sleeping when the radio crackles to life. Radio walks on stage and remarks how it’s been a long time since someone this young has been here. A young woman walks on stage and walks next to him, they chat for a bit as old friends about Girl. There is a fond send off then Radio exits. Radio is grandmas dead husband.
Memory Deluge - the girl wakes up and goes downstairs only to find grandma is not there. The memories begin, as she stares in awe and confusion, the young woman approaches from behind and jokingly scares her. 
Blah blah lots of memories, somewhere in here the young woman is revealed to be the spirit of grandma who passed in the night. At the end of the play, as the girl exits the dream state, she is holding grandmas lifeless hand and crying, the play ends here with a final number of Radio and Grandma.
Radio lurks and views proudly the memories and is ultimately a good character tho the audience should be suspicious 

I think I need directions
On how to best pretend
That I am not afraid
With every text I send

You’re the type of pretty
I think about at night
My head spinning wildly
And my eyes open with delight

I’m terrified, I’m sitting here
It took me an hour to just say
“I want to give you my number”
Please reach out to me okay?

I’m witless I’m sure,
So unable to start.
I yearn to get know you,
To find the best part.

Leave no stone unturned, no tome unscoured,
No dungeon left unguarded, no foe uncowered.
Go forth, O seeker, into shadowed halls,
Where mystery waits and the ancient calls.
Through forests deep where secrets lie,
Beneath stormy waves, 'neath open sky,
Unmask the hidden, unveil the truth,
For in knowledge gained lies eternal youth.
With courage in heart, with wisdom as might,
Arm yourself well against the creeping night.
No spell too ancient, no trap too tight—
For light shall prevail, in the dawn delight.
And when you return, with treasures and lore,
With tales of wonder and wisdom more,
The world shall know of the path you tread,
Of the stones unturned, the knowledge spread.
